# Sim-to-Real Adaptation for Detector Imagery
**Status**: Work in progress ðŸš§ | Open for contributions

**Problem**  
Machine learning models trained on simulated detector data often fail to generalize to real detector images. This "sim-to-real gap" can cause up to a 40% drop in performance, limiting the deployment of AI in CERN workflows.

**Opportunity**  
By adapting sim-trained models to perform reliably on real images, we can save weeks of manual recalibration and accelerate research pipelines in high-energy physics.

**Solution**  
This repository contains a reproducible pipeline for Sim-To-Real adaptation:
- Collect simulated detector images (public/open data)
- Collect real detector images (CERN Open Data)
- Train a baseline model on simulated detector images (CNN, contrastive embeddings)
- Apply domain adaptation techniques
  - Adversarial (DANN)
  - Contrastive/self-supervised (SimCLR, CLIP)
  - Few-shot fine-tuning on real data
- Evaluate transfer performance on real detector images
- Compare baseline vs adapted results

**Key Features**  
- Reproducible data pipeline (sim vs real)
- Adaptation methods (start simple, extendable)
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1, domain gap reduction)
- Demo notebook for easy experimentation

**Deliverables**  
- [ ] Pretrained baselines + domain-adapted models
- [ ] Benchmark results (accuracy, domain gap, energy footprint)
- [ ] Technical preprint with findings
- [ ] Open-source release with Docker support

**Impact**  
Reducing the simâ†’real gap means
- Faster model deployment
- Fewer false alarms in anomaly detection
- Improved reproducibility for HEP ML research
- Extended application in other domains (robotics, medicine, etc.)

**Status and Roadmap**
- [ ] Collect datasets
- [ ] Build baseline CNN classifier
- [ ] Implement domain adaptation methods
- [ ] Evaluate and publish benchmarks
- [ ] Write technical note / preprint
